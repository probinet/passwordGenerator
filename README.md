# Password Generator
In this challenge I had to create a password generator in Javascript when a button was clicked.


 ##Description of Application
 1. Whenever a user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, a prompt pop up asking the user how long they want the password to be.
 2. After the user types in the number of characters they want their password to be, they will be notified to answer the next three prompts with "YES" or "NO" answers.
 3. The next prompt asks the user if they want to use uppercase letters.
 4. The following prompt asks the user if they want to use numbers.
 5. The final prompt asks the user if they want to use lower case letters.
 6. They will then see their new password in the "Your Secure Password" text box
